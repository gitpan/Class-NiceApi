Class/NiceApi
=============

Perl method names should be written lowercased and multiple words should
be connected via '_'. This "is_good_coding_convention". Unfortunately
this "recommendation" is ignored by many CPAN authors. Class::NiceApi
helps pernickety programmers as me. It translates method names from
"isThisPerl" to "is_this_perl" back and forth. Well, it so flexible it
can translate allmost anything to anything. So it would translate
"perl_method_name" to java programmers favorite "perlMethodName".
